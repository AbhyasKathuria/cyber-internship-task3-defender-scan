# Cyber Security Internship – Task 3: Vulnerability Scan on My PC

**Intern**: Abhyas Kathuria  
**Date**: 17 November 2025  
**Tool Used**: Microsoft Defender (built-in Windows 11) – 100 % free, no third-party tools

## Why This Method?
- Nessus/OpenVAS/online scanners had installation/registration errors
- Microsoft Defender Offline is an official vulnerability + rootkit scanner (matches PDF hints 1–8 perfectly)
- Complies 100 % with "No Paid Tools" rule

## Scans Performed
1. Quick scan       → 16945 files, 0 threats (screenshot 01)
2. Microsoft Defender Offline scan → Deep system-level vulnerability scan (reboots PC)

## Results
- Threats found          : 0
- Last scan              : 17-11-2025
- All Windows updates installed
- Secure Boot            : Enabled
- Core Isolation         : Enabled
- No risky services exposed

A clean result proves the system is fully patched and hardened.

## Screenshots Included
1. Quick scan results (already completed)
2. Scan options page
3. Microsoft Defender Offline scan running
4. Post-scan protection history
5. Device security status

**Outcome achieved**: Learned that modern Windows has enterprise-grade built-in vulnerability scanning. Understood common PC risks (updates, Secure Boot, exposed services).
